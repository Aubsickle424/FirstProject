           <p>Hello, my name is Aubrey, and I’m a hard working student who gets good grades and is also a great daughter who does everything she’s supposed to (most of it anyways). But I wasn’t always this way, in fact I just started being this way like two weeks ago. I never want to go back to the past me.</p>

           <p>	Before I decided to make a big change in my life I was slobby, I didn’t care about my school work ( I’m homeschooled btw), or how clean my room was, or really anything important. Now, I know you might be like “You couldn’t have changed that much it’s only been two weeks!” well two weeks is how long I’ve actually been this way, but the journey to this was very long, like years long. Now I’m not going to tell you the full story, so let’s just say it took a while. Before, I used to blow things off like my chores, school ect. and the worst part was, that I lied to my mom about it. She obviously found out about it in the end and I got in trouble a lot, because as I said it took me awhile to fix this. But at that time I didn’t know it was making my life harder, I would stress over all the school I blew off, and about how my room was always dirty. It made me a lazy person, and I didn’t like that, It made me sad. So I decided to fix it!</p>

           <p>	The first time I actually tried my hardest to fix myself, was at the beginning of tenth grade,(yeah it took me awhile) the first day I got up early, got dressed, brushed my teeth, and went down stairs on time. You should’ve seen the look on my mom’s face when she saw I was the first out of my siblings to get up. She looked at me like I was the best kid ever, ( I kind of am now) but that one little moment made me feel happy and made me want to work hard. So after that I made myself some breakfast and got to work on school. Now don’t think this was easy for me it really sucked in the moment, but after I felt accomplished. First day and I already had good grades I was already doing so well, I worked really hard and surprisingly I knew everything, and was able to learn everything I didn’t know. I kept doing this for the past two weeks, and now I feel, accomplished, hardworking, and just over all great.</p>
   
           <p>	Today, even though it hasn’t been too long, I feel like the person I always wanted to be. I’m the person my family wanted me to be, who God wanted me to be. I want to keep working hard, and keep being this person. Because even though I struggle a lot ( like A LOT) I am happier than I’ve been in a while.</p>

           <p>	Thank you for reading my essay I hope that I can encourage you to also try your best because, the best you is the happiest you.</p>
